# Tac2Structure
## Tac2Structure: Object Surface Reconstruction Only through Multi Times Touch


## 1. Introduction
**Tac2Structure** is a  novel Tactile surface reconstruction framework, which can accurately estimate the egomotion of the tactile sensor and reconstruct object surfaces with low drift. Our paper is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10021601).

## 2. Usage of toolbox
```
git clone https://github.com/ljy-zju/Tac2Structure.git
cd Tac2Structure/0_creat_data_set
python data_toolbox.py
```
Replace the path in the .py file with where you want to write the .xls file in.
